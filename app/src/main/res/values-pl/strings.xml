    <string name="ipForwardingDescription">The indication of whether this entity is acting
as an IP gateway in respect to the forwarding of
datagrams received by, but not addressed to, this
entity.  IP gateways forward datagrams.  IP hosts
do not (except those source-routed via the host).
Note that for some managed nodes, this object may
take on only a subset of the values possible.
Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to
return a badValue response if a management
station attempts to change this object to an
inappropriate value.</string>
